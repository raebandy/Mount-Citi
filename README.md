# Mount Citi Guide

Welome to Mount Citi! This site is meant to be a city guide for visitors for a fictional place that I named "Mount Citi".

The site contains several pages of resources for tourists regarding Mount Citi, including Lodging info if you plan on staying, Things to Do while you're in Mount Citi, the History of the city, and a Contact form. What I hope to acheive with this site is something that anyone could use to plan an entire trip to Mount Citi, with everything you would need all on one site. The site is built with a mobile first approach and has two media breakpoints for a larger tablet screen then a full size desktop screen. 

Several CSS style features were used in the creation of this site, including Flexbox organization to resize and reorganize columns at the different media breakpoints, and a responsive navigation menu that changes styles at each breakpoint to appropriately suit each screen size. The mobile navigation menu contains a dropdown/collapsing function using a JavaScript button toggle. The site also contains a Contact form with email validation using Javascript, and the ability to send an email directly from the mailTo link in the footer of the Contact page!

I hope you enjoy!
